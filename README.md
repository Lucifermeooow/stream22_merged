# Stream 22 Pro - Multistream Studio

Official Real Mobile Multistreaming Application for Android.

## Features & Architecture

- **Real YouTube Live Integration**: Google OAuth 2.0 + YouTube Data API v3 (`liveBroadcasts.insert`, `liveStreams.insert`, `liveBroadcasts.bind`).
- **Real Facebook Live Integration**: Meta Graph API v19.0 (`/me/live_videos`).
- **Real Twitch Integration**: Twitch Helix API user validation.
- **TikTok Stream Key Ingest Support**: Zero-permission direct RTMP key binding.
- **Secure KeyStore Storage**: `flutter_secure_storage` with Android KeyStore encryption.
- **Zero-Fake Architecture**: Real live lifecycle, real account info, zero simulated data in production.

## Important architecture

The Android app publishes **one** RTMP stream to your media server. The server is responsible for fan-out to YouTube, Facebook and TikTok. The destination switches in the app are configuration/UI only; they do not fake provider APIs.

OAuth client secrets, access tokens, refresh tokens and stream keys must stay on the backend. Do not commit them to GitHub.
